# Essential Tools Installer

Automated installation scripts for essential command-line tools on Debian Linux. Build from source with optimized configurations and proper dependency management.

## Why This Project?

- **Source builds** with optimized configurations for best performance
- **Smart dependency management** - install once, share across tools
- **Multiple build types** - minimal, standard, or maximum feature sets
- **Battle-tested** - idempotent, safe, non-root installations

## Quick Start

```bash
# See what tools are available
gearbox list

# Install specific tools (recommended)
gearbox install fd ripgrep fzf jq

# Install all tools (with confirmation prompt)
gearbox install

# Fast builds for quick setup
gearbox install --minimal fd ripgrep
```
