# TUI Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Gearbox project now includes a comprehensive Text User Interface (TUI) that provides an intuitive, visual interface for all tool management operations. The TUI complements the existing CLI, offering users a choice between command-line and interactive interfaces.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dashboard View**
- System overview with installation statistics
- Recent activity tracking
- Smart recommendations based on installed tools
- Quick actions for common operations

### 2. **Tool Browser**
- Search and filter 42+ available tools
- Real-time search across names, descriptions, and languages
- Category-based filtering
- Multi-selection support
- Side-by-side preview pane

### 3. **Bundle Explorer**
- Hierarchical view of 32 curated bundles
- Organized by tiers (Foundation, Domain, Language, Workflow, Infrastructure)
- Expandable bundle details
- One-click bundle installation
- Installation progress tracking

### 4. **Install Manager**
- Real-time installation progress
- Concurrent task management
- Live output streaming
- Progress bars with stage information
- Cancel/retry capabilities

### 5. **Configuration View**
- Interactive settings management
- Type-safe configuration editing
- Validation with error feedback
- Reset to defaults option

### 6. **Health Monitor**
- Comprehensive system health checks
- Tool installation coverage analysis
- Toolchain verification
- Smart issue resolution suggestions
- Auto-refresh capability

## Technical Architecture

### Framework
- **Bubble Tea**: Elm-inspired architecture for terminal UIs
- **Lipgloss**: Styling and layout management
- **Bubbles**: Pre-built UI components (progress bars, text inputs)

### Design Patterns
- **Model-View-Update**: Reactive UI pattern
- **TaskProvider Interface**: Decouples views from task management
- **Channel-based Updates**: Real-time progress communication
- **Modular Views**: Each view is self-contained and reusable
