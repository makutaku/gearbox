echo "ðŸ§ª Testing TUI Bundle Page Scrolling Fix"
echo "========================================"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ What was fixed:"
echo "  â€¢ Added ensureSelectionVisible() method to sync viewport with selected bundle"
echo "  â€¢ Modified moveUp()/moveDown() navigation to maintain selection visibility"  
echo "  â€¢ Added viewport sync when expanding/collapsing bundles"
echo "  â€¢ Fixed selection disappearing when scrolling through expanded bundles"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ§ª Test Instructions:"
echo "  1. Launch TUI: ./build/gearbox tui"
echo "  2. Press 'b' to go to Bundle Explorer"
echo "  3. Press Enter or Space to expand a bundle (e.g. 'beginner')"
echo "  4. Use â†‘/â†“ arrows to navigate between bundles"
echo "  5. Expand more bundles and continue scrolling"
echo ""

echo "âœ… Expected Results:"
echo "  â€¢ Selection (highlighted line) should ALWAYS stay visible on screen"
echo "  â€¢ When navigating up/down, selected bundle should auto-scroll into view"
echo "  â€¢ Expanding/collapsing bundles should keep selection visible"  
echo "  â€¢ No more disappearing selection when scrolling through expanded content"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“Š Technical Fix:"
echo "  â€¢ ensureSelectionVisible(): Uses bundleLineMap for precise line tracking"
echo "  â€¢ syncViewportWithLine(): Calculates viewport bounds and scrolls appropriately"
echo "  â€¢ Integration: Called after moveUp(), moveDown(), and toggleExpanded()"
